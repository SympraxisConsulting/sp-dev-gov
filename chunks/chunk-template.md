# TL;DR
A brief summary of what the chunk is about and why it matters
 
# Main Content
 
The "meat" of the "chunk".
May contain:
* Links to Glossary terms
* Pros / cons
 
May not contain:
* Links to other chunks
* Prescriptive absolutes
 
Within the main content, we will have side sections called "In English" or "For clarity" or something. Marc thinks of this like those sections in PowerPoint decks years ago where we used this guy. Maybe something a little less corny, but using a signpost that let's the reader know there's help for the technical jargon.
 
# Summary
(Waldek does this really well on his blog posts)
